    We need your financial support to keep building a socialist movement in the Capital City.
    Whether it's strike support, canvassing, membership meetings, or educational events,
    your contributions make our organizing possible.</p>

        Sacramento DSA relies on donations to do its work, but donating isn't the same as
        joining. To join the Democratic Socialists of America, please sign up at

      For now, please bring cash to our General Membership Meetings if you'd like to contribute.
      Soon, we will have a donation link on this page where you'll be able to contribute monthly
      with a credit card - so keep checking back!
